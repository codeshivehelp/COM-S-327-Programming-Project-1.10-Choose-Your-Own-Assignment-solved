As discussed in class, the final assignment is something of your choosing. It should be of similar
complexity to the weekly assignments throughout the semester. It can be an extension to the game, it may
be something entirely standalone, or it may extend some other program. It should be in C++1
Two extensions to the game that are big enough to be an assignment:
1. Ranged combat. Add a command to select a target (cell or monster). A ranged weapon must be
wielded (bow, sling, holy hand grenade, etc.), and a second command will attack that target as long as
it remains valid. Also add a command to cast a poison ball spell. The spell centers on the target and
damages all monsters in a radius around it. Add whatever other fun and clever extensions to this idea
you like.
2. Update save and restore. We now have objects on the floor and in PC inventory and equipment. We
also have monsters. The PC and monsters have a next turn, hitpoints, etc., and the dungeon has a
character sequence number. Save all of this information to disk and reload the game from it so that it
continues correctly.
Unrelated to the game, I enjoy implementing recreational mathematics ideas. Something like the Collatz
Conjecture is certainly too simple, but you could write a program to render a fractal or two and write it to an
image file (if you want to write images, I can supply you with some very simple, easy to use code for this).
You could create Mandelbrot sets, Julia sets, Sierpinski gaskets, etc. Langton’s Ant is fun, but too small on
it’s own.
It’s always fun to calculate pi in unusual ways. You may need a library for arbitrary precision (like the
GNU MP Bignum library (GMP) or LiDIA (much more than just bignums)) to implement some of these.
Implement an encryption algorithm (also probably needs GMP).
Implement a extension to Angband or Nethack. In either case, the work would be in C, not C++, and
that would be okay, and I wouldn’t expect a lot, because you’d spend the better part of the week just getting
to know the code.
Below are a bunch of ideas related to the game. Most of them are too small by themselves, but could be
extended or combined.
• Characters regenerate hitpoints at a rate of some percentage of their maximum hitpoints per game
turn. Hint: You should not update this every game turn! That would be terribly inefficient. Instead,
mark each character with a turn number that is the last time the character’s HP were updated and
update on demand.
• Add a command to allow the user to select cells in the dungeon and get a description of monsters and
items there.
• Make lights work.
• Add spells, requiring spell books and “mana”.

I will entertain the prospect of other languages, but you’ll need to discuss it with me in advance, and if the language is managed
(i.e., does not have explicit memory management), I will reject it.
• Add spells and ranged attacks for monsters.
• Add other item effects, like resistance to elements, telepathy, ability to see invisible monsters (and
add invisible monsters!)…
• Make dodge, defense, weight, and hit item attributes meaningful.
• Add meaningful dungeon levels which load more powerful monsters as you go down, easier monsters
as you go up, perhaps a town with shops at the top.
• Add meaningful character statistics (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, etc., maybe skills)
and character levels.
• Make containers do something.
• Add new types of terrain, like water, lava, quicksand, etc., and make them affect gameplay in some
sensible way.
• Add something that sounds fun and interesting to you.
• Develop your game into something complete enough to be interesting to the roguelike community
(we’re actually not that all that far away at this point) and release it. If you release something that
gains users and continues development, it could be a very nice item on a resume´
